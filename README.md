## About the Video Course
JavaScript has become a dominant language in the form of mobile applications, browser applications, server applications, and embedded devices. Knowledgeable JavaScript engineers are in higher demand today than ever before. This course will get you up and be running with JavaScript for web and application development.
The application that you'll be building is a Slack-like chat application. You’ll learn to, share files, rate the shared photos, and more. As you progress, you'll learn the technology that underpins almost every rich web application you've ever used. You will start with the basics of JavaScript, then move on to understanding the various important components that are used to create an interactive user-friendly UI.
You’ll then learn how to route, test, and create dynamic content for your application. Then you’ll add rich features and provide the final touches to your application. By the end of the course, you’ll be able to build applications with a richer and smarter front-end using JavaScript.
